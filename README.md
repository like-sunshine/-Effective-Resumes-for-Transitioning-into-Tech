# Effective Resumes for Tech 

This workshop is going to be focused on crafting job application materials for your first tech job when you’re transitioning from another line of work. Everyone is welcome, but folks who are new to tech will be the most likely to benefit from it. 

## Prework
To get the most out of it, I ask that you come prepared with a job posting you feel is relevant to you. This doesn’t have to be a job you’re planning to apply for, though it certainly can be! 

To get the most out of this, I strongly recommend bringing your current resume and cover letter. If you do not have a resume and cover letter, that’s okay. Just be aware that it may be more challenging to get through the whole project in the allotted time. 

## Workshop
This workshop is scheduled for an hour and a half. We’ll be talking about pivoting into tech from other industries, and what that means practically speaking for your resume and cover letter. 

From there, we’ll have time set aside to work on your application materials, customizing a resume and cover letter to the job posting you selected. I’ll be available to answer any questions that pop up along the way. 

Time willing, at the end of the workshop we’ll look at work from folks who are comfortable sharing. 

If you’d like to preview the material, we’ll be working off of curriculum on the subject from Epicodus, the code school where I work as the Director of Student Services.
